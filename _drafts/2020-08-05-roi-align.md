RoI Align is a pooling method that is very simple really but not explained well in the original MaskRCNN paper. Take a look at the paper however and find out why they decided to use this method.

Previously a method called RoI-Pooling was in use. In this method the predicted bounding box is discretised and used to crop a patch from the image. This patch is then divided into a fixed number of blocks as shown below and each block is aggregated to give a single value. 

Discretisation is involved yet again here if the number of blocks does not fully divide the height or width. The problem is that due to discretisation you are not taken information from slightly different parts of the image than what the model had predicted and this results in inaccurate information getting sent downstream. 

They show that this method is particularly important for instance segmentation tasks where predictions need to match on a pixel-level which means slight shifts due to discretisation cause performance to deteriorate. However, it also turns out to work better than RoIPooling for bounding-box only models.
